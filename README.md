# Mercury Concentrations in Fish in Alberta

This project analyzes factors that impact mercury concentrations in fish across Alberta. By exploring several variables such as fish species, location, weight, length, and waterbody type, we aim to highlight potential health risks associated with consuming fish from specific water bodies where mercury levels exceed safe guidelines.

## Introduction
Mercury contamination in fish is a significant public health concern, particularly in regions like Alberta where fishing is a popular recreational activity. High levels of mercury can cause severe health issues, especially for children and pregnant women. This project seeks to provide insights into which water bodies and fish species are at the highest risk for mercury contamination, making it a valuable resource for communities that rely on fishing.

## Dataset
The dataset includes measurements of mercury concentrations in fish, along with variables such as:
- Land use region 
- Fish species
- Weight
- Length
- Waterbody location
- Waterbody type (lakes, rivers, etc.)

## Key Features
- **Mercury Concentration Analysis:** Analyzes mercury levels across different species and waterbody types.
- **Interactive Map:** Visualizes waterbodies with mercury levels. Waterbodies are marked with red points if the average mercury concentration exceeds safe consumption guidelines.
- **Health Implications:** Focuses on the health impact of mercury exposure through fish consumption and highlights areas that pose a risk to consumers.

## Analysis
This project explores the following factors:
- **Species:** Which species tend to have higher mercury concentrations?
- **Location:** Are certain regions more prone to mercury contamination?
- **Fish Size:** How do weight and length correlate with mercury levels?
- **Waterbody Type:** Which waterbody type shows higher levels of mercury contamination?

The interactive map is a key feature, displaying waterbodies across Alberta and highlighting those with mercury levels exceeding safe limits. This visual makes it easier to identify at-risk locations for consumption of local fish.

## Conclusions
- Several waterbodies, particularly lakes, were found to have fish with mercury levels that exceed safe consumption guidelines.
- Larger fish, in general, tend to accumulate more mercury.
- Certain fish species, such as Sauger, are more susceptible to mercury contamination, making them less safe for regular consumption.

This analysis serves as a critical resource for communities, particularly those with a cultural reliance on fishing, to make informed decisions about fish consumption.
